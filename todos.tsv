FALSE	1	1	22	Content	Use cases: Provide more detailed descriptions of when to use the Grand Tour method and when not to use among several dimensionality reduction techniques. 	"limitations: resnet, skip-connections layers is a simple function of a single layer before  (in discussion section:) clusters/separations - umap and tSNE seq of data: Grand Tour"	"However, I wish the article provided more detailed descriptions of when to use the Grand Tour method and when not to use among several dimensionality reduction techniques. As the Grand Tour has not been used in the context of interpreting neural nets and the authors do not seem to claim that non-linear methods should be replaced with linear ones for every case, providing some practical guidances or limitations would help researchers and practitioners get benefits from the article for their work. Discussing its limitations can also promote further research in this area."

"Discuss: when axes are interpretable and sufficiently few of them.  Todo: Move some text from technical details to body"	"The main confusion is actually about how the user is meant to take advantage of this technique and when. This seems to be about confusion over two separate things. First, the concept of moving axes vs moving selected groups of points. These distinctions are neatly identified in the math, but I do not see how this works with the user perspective. The case has been made for moving axes to get a good view, but when would the points be more appropriate? Would I have to know which ones to look at from some other source? There is some coverage of the different uses, but it needs to be organized better to lay it out from the user perspective."	"Thank you for the comment.  We now clarify this point in the beginning of the Grand Tour of layer dynamics, where we explain that direct manipulations on the axes are not satisfying for intermediate layers because (the second bullet:) there are too many dimensions to interact with and these dimensions do not have as clear semantics as the softmax layer."

Hence we need all linear projections. “ “continuum of projection” can mean grand tour/ transition/ manipulation legibility/readability  "	"The other issue is that the idea about a continuum of projections is lovely in the mathematics, but isn't really practical for understanding how a user would take advantage. In all cases it seems like the someone really needs to know exactly what they're looking for already. I think breaking this down by use cases, again by user tasks, would really clarify what this system can do. Right now, I'm left with an interesting concept, and an implementation I believe in, but no clear vision for how this helps."	"Thank you for the comment.  We explain the reason and advantage for a continuum of projections (i.e. the Grand Tour) as part of the main text. In the beginning of “the Grand Tour” section, we propose to use the Grand Tour because “…we don't know ahead of time which projection to choose from, because we don't quite know what to look for…”  Deep down, the Grand Tour allow users distinguish points that a particular linear projection may make them overlapped. It allows users to distinguish and eliminates artifacts of visualizations that any single linear projection has when users want to find low dimensional structures (e.g. triangles, lines) in high dimensional space. In the interest of length, we did not discuss this theoretical power of Grand Tour animation in length."

"Thank you for the comment.
We do agree that some intuitions about linear algebra, specifically  SVD, is helpful. However, we do not know of any short explanation of this topic other than spelling out all the details of linear algebra behind it, or this article (http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fcarc-svd) which include the geometric interpretations of SVD we used in the article.
