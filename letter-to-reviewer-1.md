Letter to Reviewer 1
> However, I wish the article provided more detailed descriptions of when to use the Grand Tour method and when not to use among several dimensionality reduction techniques. As the Grand Tour has not been used in the context of interpreting neural nets and the authors do not seem to claim that non-linear methods should be replaced with linear ones for every case, providing some practical guidances or limitations would help researchers and practitioners get benefits from the article for their work. Discussing its limitations can also promote further research in this area.

Thank you for the comment.  We added a subsection in the discussion that describes the limitations of the Grand Tour and future research directions of dimensionality reduction methods.

> Overall, the article is well-structured with a good balance between intuitive explanations using visualizations and theory behind them. But I think the presentation of the beginning part could be improved, especially by restructuring the subsections, or even simply changing the title of the Background section and/or subsections. The Background section is not just designed to provide the ‘background’ knowledge or related work, but to introduce an important motivating example used throughout the article and also present a crucial argument for the article.

Thank you for the comment.  We reordered our text and replaced the titles of subsections to ”Working Examples”, “Using Visualization to Understand DNNs”, etc.

> There exist many grammatical errors which I list a few of them below. I suggest the authors go over the article to fix them.  how neurons activates -> how neurons activate
> We have to emphasis one -> We have to emphasize one
> The In the figure below -> In the figure below
> Examples fall between sandal and sneaker classes indicates -> Examples that fall between sandal and sneaker classes indicate
> training and testing dataset -> training and testing datasets
> should be consider as -> should be considered as

Thank you for the corrections. We made a full pass of the article to eliminate such errors.
